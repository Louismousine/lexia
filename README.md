Dyslexia is a disorder that affects one's ability to read. An estimated 10% of people have this disability.

[A study](http://dyslexiahelp.umich.edu/sites/default/files/good_fonts_for_dyslexia_study.pdf) has found that some fonts significantly aid readability for people with dyslexia. The researchers cited *Helvetica, Verdana, Arial, CMU and Courier* as the best fonts to improve readability. 

Aside from Arial, these fonts are rarely used in website designs. To address this, lexia offers users the possibility to change the font of a webpage to one of the aforementioned fonts. As a Chrome extension, it is non-intrusive, and it helps improving users' experience browsing the web.
